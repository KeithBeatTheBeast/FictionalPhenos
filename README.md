# FictionalPhenos
SWI-Prolog: Just a simple "is this phenotype possible" logic program based on punnett square logic. Used for fictional universes.

This is just a simple SWI Prolog program I decided to make in my free time to 
Determine the possible phenotypes of offspring given a specified ruleset.
It is mainly for fictional characters to see if a universe obeys simple genetics by punnett square logic.
Does not have much code yet, just a few tests.
To run this code and the current tests with SWI Prolog, you will need to consult 
genotypeInformation.pl
which contains the ruleset for dominant/recessive genes (can be arbitrary, whatever you desire)

I assume you've used SWI Prolog before, and know how to import predicates using the consult command.
